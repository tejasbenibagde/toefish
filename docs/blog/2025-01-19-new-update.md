# 🚀 New Update: Exciting Enhancements and Future Plans!

## 🎉 What's New?

We’ve just rolled out an exciting new update to the library with a focus on **precision** and **performance**. This update introduces two key constructs: `BigNumber` and `BigInt`, which bring powerful capabilities for handling large numbers and high-precision arithmetic.

### New Features:
1. **`BigNumber` Class**:
   - Built on top of **Decimal.js**, the `BigNumber` class addresses floating-point precision issues and ensures complete precision for arithmetic operations.
   - Supports all basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without losing precision.
   - Added comparison utilities to check whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to another.
   
2. **`BigInt` Class**:
   - A custom implementation of JavaScript’s native `BigInt` type, specifically designed for operations on large integers.
   - Offers seamless handling of big integers without worrying about overflow, ideal for environments that target **ES2020** or higher.
   - Includes arithmetic and comparison operations for working with arbitrary-sized integers.

These two powerful constructs, `BigNumber` and `BigInt`, are now available in the library, enhancing its usability for developers working with large numbers and high precision. We are excited about how these additions will improve your experience.

## 🚀 The Future of This Library

While the current update is a significant improvement, **this is just the beginning**. We have many more features, optimizations, and improvements in store. Our mission is to continue enhancing this library and making it the **go-to solution** for precise and reliable mathematical computations.

We are actively working on:
- Further optimizations for performance.
- More advanced mathematical functions.
- Enhanced error handling and user-friendly features.
